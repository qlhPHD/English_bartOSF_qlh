Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) 
------------------------------------------------------------------

Task description
-----------------
    
This is a simplified (and prettified) version of the BART task by 
Lejuez et al (2002). Participants have to blow up a balloon that they know
will burst at some point. They 'earn' rewards for getting the balloons to be
larger, but increase the risk of bursting it, in which case they earn no 
reward for that balloon. The question is, how many times does someone pump
each balloon trying to optimise their rewards. 

The measure is designed to quantify individual differences in risk-taking.

Analysing your data
---------------------

You should filter out data where the balloon burst and measure the number of 
pumps made for the remaining trials.

Notes: 
    
This could be extended to be more similar to the original paper by adding
further colours of balloons with different bursting profiles.
